## Description

This device is targeted for hobby, when you need to assemble PCBs from time to
time. It may be not as featured as professional equipment, but it's very compact
and covers most of hobby needs.

Key points:

- Very small, don't occupy much space when not used.
- Powered from 100W USB PD charger.
- Controlled from web browser (desktop and mobile).
- Working area 70x80 mm, with temperature deviation of surface < 10°C on max power.
- Components cost < 50$.
- Up to 350°C heating temperature, for long period and without fan.
- You can easily define any heating profile you wish.

Use cases:

- Reflow soldering with Sn42bi58 (138°C) / SnPb (183°C) paste.
- Reflow soldering with Pb free (217°C) soldering paste.
- Pre-heat table (130-150°C), for soldering with air gun.
- Other needs (drying, paint baking, and others)

Due passive cool down, cooling speed on reflow may be slower than desired. But
that's acceptable trade-off for compact size.

Reflow Table Documentation
==========================

IMPORTANT: Read all documentation carefully before ordering anything!
By default, the BOM includes components only for the simple, low-cost MCPCB
heater for LTS pastes. The advanced MCH head and its BOM are described in a
separate document.

## Read first

- [bom.md](./bom.md) - bill of materials.
- [build.md](./build.md) - build guide.
- [heating_heads.md](./heating_heads.md) - overview of the available heaters
  and their limits.
- [soldering_paste.md](./soldering_paste.md) - quick notes for beginners on
  soldering paste.
- [calibration.md](./calibration.md) - how to tune the device after assembly.
- [user manual](./user_manual.md) - how to use the device.

## Advanced

- [mch_head](./mch_head/) - details on the alternate experimental heater.
- [modeling](./modeling/) - Python notebooks for simulating the heating process
  in different conditions.
